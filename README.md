Analysis-Notes
==============
This repo contains all the handwritten notes from Professor Imamoglu's Analysis I/II class for CS at ETHZ. 

Getting the material
====================
In order to get the material, there are two ways:
<ol>
<li>Get a PDF file, containing all of the notes. This version might not be as up to date as the source files, but it is usually corrected and checked. Use this option of you are not familiar with LaTex or GitHub</li>
<li>Typeset (Build) it yourself from source. This is in order to have the latest version available, kind of like beta for software. (WARNING: MIGHT CONTAIN ERRORS IN THE TEXT)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For option 1</li>
<ol>
<li>Download the .zip archive <a href="https://github.com/pennatil/Analysis-Notes/archive/master.zip">here</a></li>
<li>Unzip it, you will find a folder named "Notes", open it</li>
<li>Look for a PDF file named "main.pdf". Move it and rename it if you like</li>
<li>You can now delete the "Notes" folder</li>
</ol>
<li>For Option 2</li>
<ol><li>Take a look at the "Building" section in this document</li></ol></ul>

Building
========
This is only for people familiar with LaTex. If you have never used it before, just use the PDF included in the .zip archive!

First of all make sure you have a working LaTex distribution installed on your system. If you don't just google ''latex ''+ your OS, download and install. 
Download the master Branch, unzip it and open the file Packages.tex. Make sure that you have all of these packages installed (especially if you are on linux).
<ul>
<li>If you use the terminal, navigate to the folder and build main.tex. Build it at least 2 times!!</li>
<li>If you use an ''IDE'', just open main.tex and create a pdf using the export button (most of them have one)</li>
</ul>

Contributing
============
If you wish to contribute to the notes, there are two ways:
<ul>
<li>If you have no experience with LaTex or GitHub:
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a GitHub account, otherwise create one. Please use the same name as your ETHZ account, makes m life much easier if I have to contact you.</li>
<li>On the right side of this page, click on the "Issues" tab</li>
<li>Check if no one else has posted the same Issue. If no one has, Open a new issue, stating:
<ul>
<li>Chapter + Page Number</li>
<li>Issue found, plus the eventual correction(s)</li>
</ul>
<li>Send the Issue, I will probably just close the Issue and send you a message or email once I have corrected the problem.
</ol>
<li>If you are familiar with Latex and GitHub:
<ol>
<li>Fork the repo. Help <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">here</a>. </li>
<li>Make the changes, and commit them to your forked repo. Make sure to add detailed comments explaining what you changed, makes my life a lot easier when merging!</li>
<li>Once you are done, request a Merge. Help <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">here</a>. </li>
</ol>
<li>I will try to merge it as soon as possible, and once done I will probably send you a message or email</li>
</ol>
</ul>
Once you have used one of these methods, I will try to fix the problem/merge your solution as soon as I can!
